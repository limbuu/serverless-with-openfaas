## OpenFaaS
[OpenFaas](https://docs.openfaas.com/) is an opensource serverless tool primarily used to deploy event-driven functions and microservices without repetitive, boiler-plate coding. OpenFaaS can be deployed to a variety of container orchestrators such as [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift), [Docker Swarm](https://github.com/docker/classicswarm) or to a single host with [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd). Just package your code or an existing binary in a Docker image to deploy as functions or microservices and get a highly scalable endpoint with autoscaling and metrics. It is also possible to use other forms of event triggers such as Apache Kafka for OpenfaaS functions. 

Main Features:
* Ease of use through UI portal and one-click install.
* Write functions in any language for Linux or Windows and package in Docker/OCI image format.
* Portable - runs on existing hardware or public/private cloud with Kubernetes or containerd.
* CLI available with YAML format for templating and defining functions.
* Auto-scales as demand increases.
